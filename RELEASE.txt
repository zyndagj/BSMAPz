release 1.1.1
1. Fixed methylation ratio calculation in methdiff.py:

	added -3 for 3 nucleotide mapping mode
	restored -r 2 to report all multiple hits
	added -V [0,1,2] to set verbose level

release 2.74
1. fixed a bug in quality trimming step.

09-03-2012
release 2.73
1. added -k option to skip over-represented kmers in seed searching.
2. fixed a bug in methrato.py that flipped the 9th and 10th columns in the output.

08-07-2012
release 2.72
1. set the default CT_SNP handling option (-i) of methratio.py to "correct", in previous
version the default was set to "skip", which is inconsistent with the
default value in help message and causes confusions.

08-05-2012
release 2.71
1. fixed a bug in quality trimming step.
2. if -o option is omitted, the output will be written to STDOUT in SAM format.
This is useful to pipe the output to downstream tools.  For example, pipe
into samtools to get BAM format, instead convert to BAM after mapping, see README examples.
3. removed -2 option, all mapping output will be written into one file for BSP format

07-24-2012
release 2.7

4. allow -v option to specify mismatch rate
    if -v is set between 0 and 1, it's interpreted as the mismatch rate w.r.t to the read length.
    otherwise it's interpreted as the maximum number of mismatches allowed on a read, <=15.
    example: -v 5 (max #mismatches = 5), -v 0.1 (max #mismatches = read_length * 10%)
    default=0.08.
5. added -H option to avoid print SAM header.
6. fixed a bug in automatically converting SAM file to BAM format.
7. add options in methyratio.py script:
    -i CT_SNP, --ct-snp=CT_SNP      how to handle CT SNP ("no-action", "correct", "skip")
    -n, --no-header                 avoid print header line in the methratio output.
8. updated the samtools subdirectory to the latest version (0.1.18).
9. eliminated some compilation warnings.

04-09-2012
release 2.6
1. optimized seed patterns for mapping speed.

5. add 95% confidence interval for eatimated methylation ratios in the methratio.py output.
6. add options in methratio.py script
    -t, --trim-fillin       trim fill-in nucleotides in dsDNA end-repairing.

2. set the default number of threads (-p opition) to the number of CPU cores detected (up to 8).
3. execute sam2bam.sh and samtools in system default path for BAM format output.
4. added python script bsp2sam.py to convert BSP format output to SAM format.

01-11-2012
release 2.4
1. optimized seed patterns, up to 40% faster than v2.3.
2. change -z option from -z <char> to -z <int>, since the zero quality char '!' is a special char in linux shell
    -z @ is now -z 64 (solexa quality)
    -z "!" is now -z 33 (sanger quality), which is the default setting.
3. added -L <int> option to map the first N nucleotides of a read.
4. re-wrote the methratio.py script, much faster and use less memory (~26GB) for
whole genome methylation ratio extraction.
    changed the syntax of options:
        ref=<ref_file> is changed to -d <ref_file> or --ref=<ref_file>
        chrom=<chr> is changed to -c <chr> or --chr=<chr>
    added options:
        -u, --unique    process only unique mappings

        -s, --sam-path  set the path to samtools

12-12-2011
release 2.3
1. added -M <str> option to allow other special alignments instead of C=>T bisulfite
alignment, for example, -M GA could used to detect A=>I editing in RNA-seq.
2. added -n <int> option to set mapping strand information.  -n 0 only map reads to 2
forward strands, and -n 1 map reads to all 4 possible strands
3. the output reference sequence were expanded by two nucleotide (in lower
cases) to include seqeunce context information. (ie, CG, CHG or CHH)
4. added two options for the methratio.py script.
    chrom=<chr> select the chromosomes to process, so that large
    dataset could be broken into chromosomes to use less RAM.
    ref=<ref_file>  specify the reference fasta file when the BSMAP output
    does not include reference sequence.
